## Kye Bracey

I am an enthusiastic and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, trained at Makers Academy.
My two favourite questions are "How does it work?" and "Can I make it better?".

Having been home-educated for most of my life, I learned the importance of self-discipline and persistence, two qualities I still highly value.

After graduating with a music degree and spending three years working in sales/insurance, I have now turned towards where my head and my heart have always been, and am looking for a junior developer role in the London area, with a company that values writing high-quality, well-tested code, agile delivery and XP Values.

## Skills

#### Dedicated and Reliable

While working at Cigna, my seniors quickly recognized my meticulous approach to completing tasks - one manager (in)famously said "If you want it done right, give it to Kye".

At Makers Academy, I have gained a reputation among my cohort for being able to stick at tough problem long after the group morale has gone downhill.

#### Excellent Communication Skills

While working on a large-scale proofreading project at Cigna, the project head asked me to teach my comment format to the rest of the group, who said that it made things easier for them and made their own notes more readable.

We regularly launched new products at Cigna, and when we did I enjoyed making 'cheatsheets' to help myself and my colleagues remember large amounts of information.  I also became renowned for being able to explain policy clauses and complicated phrases in easy-to-understand terms.

I continue to improve my written communication skills by [blogging](https://medium.com/@kye.bracey) about my experience at Makers Academy.  I also enjoy leading group standups and retros.

#### Quick and Eager Learner

I am happiest when either learning something new, or improving an existing skill.  Working in a heavily-regulated financial service, where high standards were constantly in demand, helped me improve my ability to learn new skills and processes fully in a short space of time.

At Makers Academy, I learned JavaScript in the space of one week.  For my final project myself and my group learned how to write and test code in React Native to build a mobile app in ten days (Makers Academy do not teach us anything about writing mobile apps).
