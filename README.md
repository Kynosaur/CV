## Kye Bracey

I am currently training at Makers Academy to become a full stack web/software developer.
My two favourite questions are "How does it work?" and "Can I make it better?".
Fun fact: While I was in primary school teachers (sometimes of classes 3+ years above mine) would send for me to help fix an issue with the class computer.

Leaving primary school early, I was home-educated for most of my school-age years, and during that time I learned the importance of self-discipline and seeing a task through to completion, two qualities which have remained important to me into my adult life.

After graduating with a music degree and spending three years working in sales/insurance, I have now turned towards where my head and my heart have always been, and am looking for a junior developer role around the London area.

## Skills

#### Dedicated and Reliable

My brain does not like unfinished tasks - when I got my first Rubik's cube (at the age of 14) I sat down for six hours trying to solve it, until my parents became worried and confiscated it.
I have since refined this quality to take my wellbeing in to account, and thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction of seeing a challenging task through to its completion.

While working at Cigna, my seniors quickly recognized my meticulous approach to completing tasks and frequently requested my help with extra tasks.  One manager (in)famously said "If you want it done right, give it to Kye".

At Makers Academy, I have gained a reputation among my cohort for being able to stick at tough problem long after the group morale has gone downhill.

#### Excellent Communication Skills

While working on a large-scale proofreading project for the print company of Cigna, the project head asked me to teach my feedback and annotation format to the rest of the group, who commented that it made things easier for them and made more sense when they read their own notes back.

I impressed my managers at Cigna with my letter-writing and note-taking skills, and as a result I had the opportunity to take minutes for our weekly meetings (which quickly became an email my team looked forward to reading every week), and also wrote letters to our 'VIP' clients when required.  I also became renowned for being able to explain policy clauses and complicated phrases in easy-to-understand terms.

I continue to improve my written communication skills by [blogging](https://medium.com/@kye.bracey) about my experience at Makers Academy.  I also enjoy leading group standups and retros,

#### Quick and Eager Learner

I am happiest when I am either learning a new skill, or improving an existing skill.  I impressed the management team at Cigna with how quickly I picked up the processes and technologies they used,
and this resulted in my garnering many additional responsibilities including proofreading scripts, helping with policy wording changes and using the call recording/playback system to help find root causes of issues
and resolve complaints.  Working in a heavily regulated financial services setting, where high standards were constantly in demand, helped me improve my ability to learn new skills and processes fully in a short space of time.

## Interests and Hobbies

- **Puzzles, especially Rubik's cubes** - I have managed to solve cubes all the way up to 5x5,
and have solved a 3x3 in less than 30 seconds.  I am currently working towards being able to perform a sub-20-seconds solve.

- **Recording and editing video and audio** - My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCra74TRV4yc5jnTjo-t91Rg) features many gameplay-with-commentary and tutorial videos presented to a high standard.  
However, as this was a very time-consuming hobby I have halted uploads for now, but still record and edit the occasional clip to keep the skills up to scratch.

- **Additional hobbies:**
I have amassed a wide range of hobbies, including but not limited to(!) ice-skating, tap dancing, ballet, piano and guitar (as my main instruments - not at the same time however!), circus skills - especially (fire-)poi and juggling - and karate.
