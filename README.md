## Kye Bracey

Full stack web developer/software engineer, trained at Makers Academy.
My two favourite questions are "How does it work?" and "Can I make it better?".
Fun fact: While I was in primary school teachers (sometimes of classes 3+ years above mine) would send for me to help fix an issue with the class computer.

Having been home-educated for most of my life, I learned the importance of self-discipline and persistence, two qualities I still highly value.

After graduating with a music degree and spending three years working in sales/insurance, I have now turned towards where my head and my heart have always been, and am looking for a junior developer role in the London area.

## Skills

#### Dedicated and Reliable

My brain does not like unfinished tasks - when I got my first Rubik's cube (at the age of 14) I sat down for six hours trying to solve it, until my parents became worried and confiscated it.
I have since refined this quality to take my wellbeing in to account, and thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction of seeing a challenging task through to its completion.

While working at Cigna, my seniors quickly recognized my meticulous approach to completing tasks - one manager (in)famously said "If you want it done right, give it to Kye".

At Makers Academy, I have gained a reputation among my cohort for being able to stick at tough problem long after the group morale has gone downhill.

#### Excellent Communication Skills

While working on a large-scale proofreading project at Cigna, the project head asked me to teach my comment format to the rest of the group, who said that it made things easier for them and made their own notes more readable.

I impressed my managers at Cigna with my letter-writing and note-taking skills - my meeting minutes email became an anticipated event of every week. I was tasked with writing letters to our 'VIP' clients when required.  I also became renowned for being able to explain policy clauses and complicated phrases in easy-to-understand terms.

I continue to improve my written communication skills by [blogging](https://medium.com/@kye.bracey) about my experience at Makers Academy.  I also enjoy leading group standups and retros.

#### Quick and Eager Learner

I am happiest when either learning something new, or improving an existing skill.  I impressed the management team at Cigna with how quickly I picked up the processes and technologies they used.  Working in a heavily-regulated financial service, where high standards were constantly in demand, helped me improve my ability to learn new skills and processes fully in a short space of time.

## Interests and Hobbies

- **Puzzles, especially Rubik's cubes** - I have managed to solve cubes all the way up to 5x5,
and have solved a 3x3 in less than 30 seconds.  I am currently working towards being able to perform a sub-20-seconds solve.

- **Recording and editing video and audio** - My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCra74TRV4yc5jnTjo-t91Rg) features many gameplay-with-commentary and tutorial videos presented to a high standard.  
However, as this was a very time-consuming hobby I have halted uploads for now, but still record and edit the occasional clip to keep these skills up to scratch.

- **Additional hobbies:**
I have amassed a wide range of hobbies, including but not limited to(!) ice-skating, tap dancing, ballet, piano and guitar (as my main instruments - not at the same time however!), circus skills - especially (fire-)poi and juggling - and karate.
